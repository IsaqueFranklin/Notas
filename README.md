# Notas
A simple notebook app.

For use it as a notebook just put organize the files in their proper folders such as:

- views => another 3 folders inside it: layouts containing: main.handlebars; partials containing: _mag.handlebars,_navbar.handlebars; users containing: addnota.handlebars, index.handlebars, notas.handlebars
- routes containing: users.js
- models containing: Nota.js
- app.js => this file goes alone

 and another folder called public where you must put all the front-end frameworks such as bootstrap, materialize, well whatever you want, just don't forget to change the code in the files if you modify anything.
